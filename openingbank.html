			<h2>1. What do you need?</h2>
			<p>First things first: to open a Dutch bank you need to have a couple of documents and papers. Here’s what you’ll need:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A valid <span>identity</span></li>
					<li>Proof of <span>address</span></li>
					<li>Your <span>BSN number</span></li>
					<li>Some banks also ask for an enrollment at your university or college</li>
				</ul>
			<p>When everything is complete you can proceed to the next step.</p>

			<h2>2. Find a bank</h2>
			<p>When opening a bank account in the Netherlands, it’s a good idea to shop around and weigh up the different pros and cons of all options available. Depending on preferences, you might prioritize different features. Things to look out for can include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Costs</span> (each bank charges monthly or yearly fees)</li>
				<li><span>Service</span> (each bank has different ways of serving their customers)</li>
				<li><span>Accessibly</span> (some banks work with apps and others can only be reached physically)</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>3. Get your card</h2>
			<p>After you have applied and opened your bank account, you will receive a letter with your debit card. Some banks might ask you to come pick it up but normally you'll get your card in the mail. The letter will also contain the pin code that can be used in combination with the card.</p>
			<p>Now you are ready to start spending your money!</p>
